# Scenario: Pod stuck in Terminating
# A finalizer blocks deletion; the API server waits for the finalizer to be removed.
# Pod stays "Terminating" until the finalizer is removed (e.g. via kubectl patch).

# Optional: Deployment that runs a normal pod; delete the deployment and
# immediately add a finalizer to one of its pods to simulate "stuck terminating"
# (advanced: kubectl patch pod <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":["example.com/block"]}}')
